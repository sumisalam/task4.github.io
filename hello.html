		<h1> my opinion and contributions as a responsible keralite</h1>
		<p>i am really proud as a kerealtive to survive the situation. i have never been this proud as a malayali. people of kerela has faced the situation in a courageous and positive way.people among themselves helped each other to tackle the situation to save lives of their neighbourhood and people. people ranging from school students lend hands to contribute whatever they had to the relief fund to raise the fund.even the actors in malayalam industry like tovino,indhrajit and many more came forward volunteering and helping people rescue in and around the flooded areas.it was a mass contributed and involved rescue seesion. the missions of navy in this destruction were mindblowing and thought provoking, relief camps were voluntereed by several professional students of  kerela. most of the colleges of kerela turned to relief camps accomadating  rescued people  . these camps were well organized for packing and distributions to several other relief camps amd to people who were stuck  in their homes due to various conditions.food, shelter,basic needs,clothing were provided to the people in camps<br></p>
		<p>AS a proud MESCEian i can say how well our students actively contributed to help people in and around places nearby.relief camp were setup inside the college,funds were collected and donated to specific places in need. responsibly volunteered by students and monitored by staffs who stood for the cause till the end.basic materials that is needed for a family after the flood were collected and purchased which was then distributed to affected families and those who are in need by the volunteers of college.<br></p>
		<p>I as a keralite and student helped my nearby relief camp ,the thottakad relief camp which accomadated people who lost houses due to major land slides.my family conributed amount of 20,000 rupee to thr relief fund. i too contributed a small amount of Rs 500 to the collection centre in our college. we as a family even helped clean our neihjbourhood and homes that were badly damaged and contaminated due to the flood.<br>
		These all were a wonderful experience in my life and a proud moment as a malayali!.
		Kerala will rise and shine again with glory and get back to normal soon.
		WE STAND UNITED AND WE WILL RISE UNITED!!!!</p>
